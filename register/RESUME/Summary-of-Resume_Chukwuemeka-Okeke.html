         <h4><p><strong> PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE </strong></p></h4>
         <h4><p><strong>One Precious Life (OPL) Academy                                                    February 2020 – Till Date </strong></p></h4>
         <h4><p><strong>Training Lead (AEP)/Training Coordinator</strong></p></h4>
         <h4><p><strong>Achievements:</strong></p></h4>
         <h5><p>•   Started off as a training coordinator supporting the training team with candidate sourcing, training, and placement for its flagship Artisan Empowerment Program (AEP). The impact of my addition to the team lead to an increase in the candidates trained in 2020 by 15% through varied initiatives shared across the training spectrum.</p></h5>
         <h5><p>•	I was able to coordinate the end-to-end process from recruitment to training thereby leading to placement of an entire batch of tradesmen and women for the largest class we trained for in 2020. This was achieved with the support of the team.</p></h5>
         <h5><p>•	When the COVID-19 pandemic occurred, I worked with the training manager to pilot four (4) online training sessions on Zoom. This moved away from the traditional physical session and helped us scale our training sessions.</p></h5>
         <h5><p>•	I assisted the training team develop strategies on curriculum review, improve facilitation sessions and overall training processes in the department which produced an increase in candidates’ module retention and application rating.</p></h5>
         <h5><p>•	Within six (6) months as a training coordinator, with the support of the entire team, I was able to build capacity and was promoted to the Training Lead of the flagship Artisan Empowerment Program (AEP), the very crucial aspect of the organization.</p></h5>
         <h5><p>•	I also support the team with organizing and leading strategic team and departmental sessions geared towards improving systems and outcomes, an example would be leading the “Book Review Session” for the year 2020 till date and the Design Thinking sessions as well.</p></h5>
         <h5><p>•	I introduced and successfully run a “Situational Judgement Based Assessment” for our entry tradesmen that seeks to assess their level of awareness and impact of the skills we train for. I do this by running the assessment, grading, drawing insights and making reports to improve outcomes of trainees learning. This improved the overall monitoring and evaluation process and helped us scale impact hugely.</p></h5>
         <h5><p>•	The drive to achieve and grow on the job earned me the opportunity to train for the Lagos State Employment Trust Fund (LSETF) in conjunction with other relevant government and corporate bodies on several projects across different states in Nigeria both in-person and virtually.</p></h5>
